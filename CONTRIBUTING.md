# Contributing to mgcpy
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Use a consistent coding style
We use [pep8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
To setup,
- `pip install pycodestyle`
- Run `./install_hooks.sh` to install the pre-commit hooks for enforcing **pep8** before committing any code.

## Report bugs (using GitHub's issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/neurodata/mgcpy/issues), it's that easy!
- Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
- **Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

  - A quick summary and/or background
  - Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code
  - What you expected would happen
  - What actually happens
  - Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work, screenshots, etc.)

## Proposing new features / fixes
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `development`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
